# About Me

Hello I am Tong! I am aspiring engineering student at Rosemead High School.
I enjoy my time baking a fresh batch of brownies and perfecting my matcha latte
recipe. Other than that, I like to volunteer at different marathons and walks
and explore the city with my friends. One of my bucket list items is to learn
how to figure skate!
